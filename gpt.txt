Constructor chaining is a technique in Java that allows one constructor to call another constructor within the same class or in its superclass.
 This technique is useful for reducing code duplication and improving code readability.

In Java, every class has at least one constructor.
 If you do not define any constructor for your class, Java automatically generates a default constructor with no parameters.
 You can define your own constructors with parameters that initialize the fields of your class.
 However, if you want to call another constructor from within your constructor, you can use the this() keyword.

Here's an example of constructor chaining in Java:
